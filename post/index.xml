      <description>SMI Traffic split with Linkerd2 This year I had the opportunity to speak at the KubeCon Barcelona. It was my first KubeCon and my first big talk abroad. I&amp;rsquo;m going to let the youtube video here:
  But this post it&amp;rsquo;s not about it, sorry for the personal marketing. Back in track, on this KubeCon was announced the Service Mesh Interface (SMI). &amp;ldquo;A standard interface for service meshes on Kubernetes&amp;rdquo; as its slogan says.</description>

      <description>Hello World! I was in the last years thinking about my debt with the community and my responsibility to write about methodologies, technologies and others *ies that I face in my day-to-day and may be useful to other people.
A simple way to give back to the community all that I learned and get my communication skills better.
Like every first post, I think that there isn’t much to say.</description>
